* **Date**: August 2024
* **Technologies**: Python, TensorFlow, Keras, scikit-learn, Google Colab, Matplotlib, Seaborn
* **Description**: Developed a classification model to diagnose breast cancer using machine learning techniques.
  * **Data Preprocessing**:
    - Loaded and cleaned data using pandas.
    - Handled missing values by dropping columns with all missing data.
    - Encoded categorical labels using LabelEncoder.
    - Applied MinMaxScaler to normalize feature values.
  * **Model Development**:
    - Built a deep learning model with TensorFlow and Keras, featuring a Sequential architecture with Dense and Dropout layers.
    - Trained the model for 100 epochs with a batch size of 64, using binary crossentropy and adam optimizer.
  * **Evaluation**:
    - Analyzed training and validation performance with accuracy-loss curves.
    - Evaluated model using confusion matrix and heatmap visualizations.
